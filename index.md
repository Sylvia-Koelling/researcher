I am a German native speaker with extensive experience teaching German one-on-one.
I grew up near Dresden where I went to school and university and have lived in Manchester since 2006.
I have taught pupils at GCSE and A-Level, and adults from A1 to B2 level. I have also worked with German undergraduate students and helped them prepare for their year abroad and exams.

# What I offer

## Teaching
I focus on supporting an individual's abilities and what they want to achieve. I have a lot of experience working one-on-one and really tailor my teaching to the student.

You want to live abroad and practice German communication? No problem, we'll spend our lessons predominantly talking and I'll answer any grammatical questions that may occurr.

You want to improve your school German and focus on preparing for a language test? Let's do it -- I have a lot of experience explaining grammar in an accessible way.

You need German for work? We can do that too! Simply get in touch and I'll see how I can help you.

## Translation
I offer translation from German into English and from English into German. I am very familiar with both cultural contexts and can thus work accurately and reliably.

# Costs

## Teaching
£25 per hour one-on-one teaching.

## Translation
£50 basic fee per job plus £1.50 per line (55 characters incl. spaces).
